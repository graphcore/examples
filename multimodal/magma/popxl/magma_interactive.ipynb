For all the details, please refer to the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.05253) and the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/Aleph-Alpha/magma).

    "## Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Magma uses GPT-J, but in the code you can find references to GPTNeo, and this can be confusing. The model is GPT-J 6B but not taken from the official Hugging Face transformer library. Instead, they use [finetuneanon/transformer](https://github.com/finetuneanon/transformers). In this library, [GPTNeo](https://github.com/finetuneanon/transformers/tree/gpt-neo-localattention3-rp-b/src/transformers/models/gpt_neo) with the options `jax=True`, `rotary=True` and `global` attention corresponds to GPT-J.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input preprocessing\n",
    "#### Textual input\n",
    "The input text is tokenized using GPT2 tokenizer.\n",
    "It is then padded up to `sequence_len - 144`, where `sequence_len` is specified in the configs and 144 is the number of image tokens generated by the image encoder.\n",
    "#### Image input\n",
    "The input image is resized, cropped and normalised using Magma [clip_preprocess](https://github.com/Aleph-Alpha/magma/blob/master/magma/transforms.py) function.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next token generation\n",
    "Given an image and a text prompt, the model outputs logits for the sequence.\n",
    "Logits corresponding to the last token in the sequence are used to predict the next token.\n",
    "Several heuristics are supported:\n",
    "- argmax: simply pick the token with the highest probability. This is a deterministic sampling method.\n",
    "- top-p: probability is redistributed among the first x tokens such that the cumulative probability is greater than a threshold p. Then, next token is sampled from such distribution (categorical sampling, non deterministic).\n",
    "- top-k: probability is redistributed among the K most-likely tokens. Then, next token is sampled from such distribution (categorical sampling, non deterministic).\n",
    "- temperature: logits are scaled by a factor 1/T (T between 0 and 1 ) before applying the softmax. This makes the distribution more peaked for low temperature, and broader for high temperatures. A zero temperature corresponds to a deterministic choice (argmax), while sampling output becomes more random as we increase the temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with these concepts, this [HuggingFace article](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate) can help you visualise them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The new token is added to the input sequence, and the process goes on until `max_out_tokens` are generated or the model outputs the `EOS` token.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Execution scheme\n",
    "The model is run using phased execution.\n",
    "This means that the model is partitioned into a set of smaller graphs that are executed in series on the IPU, using remote memory to store variables and input/output tensors between calls (activations).\n",
    "We recommend going through the tutorial [Phased Execution in MNIST example](https://github.com/graphcore/examples/tree/master/tutorials/tutorials/popxl/6_phased_execution) to better understand this execution scheme.\n",
    "- The first phase corresponds to the image prefix. The output of this phase produces image embeddings that are concatenated to the (tokenized) textual input\n",
    "- The following phase is the GPT-J embedding phase, which produces text embeddings.\n",
    "- Image embeddings and text embeddings are concatenated and fed to GPT-J blocks. Each block constitutes a different phase.\n",
    "- The final phase is the LM head, producing logits to be used for the next token prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The GPT-J model makes use of tensor parallelism, spanning across 4 IPUs. More details about the implementation are available in the [GPT-J Notebook]().\n"
