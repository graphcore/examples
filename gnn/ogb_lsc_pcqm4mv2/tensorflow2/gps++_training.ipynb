    "The challenge is to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap [[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HOMO_and_LUMO) of \n",
    "organic molecules, a useful property correlated to the stability of a compound. \n",
    "Typically, such values are obtained from density functional theory (DFT) using high-performance compute (HPC) methods. These\n",
