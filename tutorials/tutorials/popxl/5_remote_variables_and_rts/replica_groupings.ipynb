    "Generally speaking, a `ReplicaGrouping` object defines a group of IPUs.\n",
    "Replica groupings are used in two different contexts:\n",
    "- **Variables** : the replica group of a variable identifies the IPUs over which the variable is the same. The variable assumes the same value on IPUs that belongs to the same group.\n",
    "- **Collectives** : in collectives, replica groups are used to define which IPUs need to communicate. Communication happens between IPUs in the same group."

    "## Definition\n",
    "A ReplicaGrouping is specified using a `group_size` and a `stride`.\n",
    "- The **group_size** tells how many IPUs are in the group.\n",
    "- The **stride** defines which IPUs are in the same group. Specifically, it tells the distance between IPUs belonging to the same group.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create a replica group, you can use the following syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ir = popxl.Ir(replication=replicas)\n",
    "rg = ir.replica_grouping(stride=1, group_size=4)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a certain group_size, \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{num_groups} = \\text{replicas} // \\text{group_size}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "will be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since this must be an integer, not all values of parameters are allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to specify both the stride and the group_size.\n",
    "- If you only specify the stride, the group_size is assumed to be `group_size = replicas//stride`.\n",
    "- If you only specify the group_size, a unitary stride is assumed.\n",
    "- The **default** group, created with `ir.replica_grouping()` is *all replicas in the same group*: a single group with `group_size=replicas` and `stride=1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A ReplicaGrouping defines an **assignment**. When a group is created, each IPU is given a number `0, ..., num_groups`. IPUs with the same number belong to the same group.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your tastes, it may be more intuitive to think about groups in terms of assignments or in terms of IPU indices. \n",
    "In the cells below, we provide a short snippet that leverage both visualisations."

So if the assignment is `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]` so place IPUs 0,2,4,6 in column 1, IPUs 1,3,5,7 in column 1.
