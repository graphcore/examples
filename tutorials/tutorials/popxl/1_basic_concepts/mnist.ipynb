    "## Basic concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are basic concepts of popxl.addons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Module`: a module is the base class to build layers and models. It is similar\n",
    "  to a PyTorch Module or a Keras Layer. It allows you to create a **graph** with\n",
    "  **state**, which means with internal parameters (such as weights). Graphs can\n",
    "  be called from multiple places in parent graphs, which reduces code\n",
    "  duplication.\n",
    "- `NamedTensors` : a `DotTree` collection of `popxl.Tensor`, which is basically\n",
    "  a dictionary between names and tensors. `DotTree` are used in `addons` for all\n",
    "  collections of named objects. They are very useful to group objects in\n",
    "  namespaces.\n",
    "- `VariableFactory` and `NamedVariableFactories` (a `DotTree` collection of\n",
    "  factories): factories are used to delay variable instantiation to the main\n",
    "  graph.\n",
    "- `GraphWithNamedArgs`: it is a container of a `popxl.Graph` and `NamedTensors`.\n",
    "  `NamedTensors` are the graph named inputs. When a `GraphWithNamedArgs` is\n",
    "  created with `Module.create_graph()`, factories for each of the input tensors\n",
    "  are instantiated as well.\n",
    "- `transforms` are functions that directly modify the graph, generating a new\n",
    "  one. An example is the `addons.autodiff` transform, which, given a graph,\n",
    "  produces the corresponding backward graph.\n",
    "- `BoundGraph`: it is a container of a `popxl.Graph` and a `TensorMap` of bound\n",
    "  Tensor inputs, which are automatically provided as inputs when the graph is\n",
    "  called.\n",
