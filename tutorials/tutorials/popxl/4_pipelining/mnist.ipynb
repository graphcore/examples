    "\n",
    "Up to now, we've run the entire model on a single IPU. This requires\n",
    "the variables (and other tensors) of all layers to fit within the IPU's memory. However, large models may exceed the memory capacity on a single IPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train such models while maintaining high IPU utilisation we can use  [**Pipelining**](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/3.3.0/algorithmic_techniques.html?highlight=micro%20batch#model-parallelism-and-pipelining): we first split the model into **independent parts** ( pipeline **stages** ) and then setup the program so that they can be **executed by different IPUs in parallel** (thus, it is a form of **model parallelism**).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Efficient parallel execution with pipelining\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a model made of three layers and we define five pipeline stages:\n",
    "- layer1 forward on IPU0\n",
    "- layer2 forward on IPU1\n",
    "- layer3 forward, loss computation, layer3 backward on IPU3\n",
    "- layer2 backward on IPU1\n",

    "\n",
    "If only a batch is processed at each time, the pipeline is very inefficient, because we have a data dependency between the stages and they can't execute in parallel: only one ipu will be active.\n",

    " </figcaption>\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement pipelining efficiently, we need to **break the data dependency** by loading multiple micro batches and having each pipeline stage running in parallel on a different micro batch.\n",
    "Gradient accumulation is perfect here, since we also need to keep the weights of the layers frozen during the whole pipeline execution and update them only at the end. \n",

    " <figcaption> <b>Fig 2: </b> Efficient pipelining: multiple micro batches are loaded using gradient accumulation. Pipeline stages can execute in parallel <b>on different micro batches</b> and all IPUs are used in the main phase when the pipeline is full ( while in the ramp up and ramp down phase only a few are active)\n",
    " </figcaption>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Activation Stash and Recomputation\n",
    "Note that the gradient computation for a layer requires the layers activations calculated with respect to the same batch. In a pipeline, this computation is separated in time: when the IPU is running the backward for the layer, it has already run `backward_stage - forward_stage` forward steps. Hence we need to save all the forward activations in a FIFO queue of length `backward_stage - forward_stage`, the **activation stash**. This can be inconvenient from a memory perspective. We can instead choose to recompute the activations (all or some) to save memory at the expense of extra computation.\n",
    "See also the [memory stashes and recomputation](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/3.3.0/algorithmic_techniques.html?highlight=micro%20batch#memory-stashes-and-recomputation) paragraph in the ipu programmer guide.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Efficient pipelining best practices\n",
    "\n",
    "- With pipelining, the **`gradient_accumulation`** factor needs to be greater than **2 * number of pipeline stages** (Fig 2 shows it clearly). The greater, the better the IPUs utilisation since in that case ramp up and ramp down phases, when not all IPUs are active, only take a small fraction of the execution.\n",
    "- To get the best utilisation, the layers across the IPUs should be balanced such that they each take roughly the same amount of time to compute. \n",
    "- Forward and backward stages for the same layers should be defined on the same IPU, since they require the same parameters. Moreover, backward requires the layer activations.\n"

    "### The pipeline transform \n",
    "Before implementing a pipeline you should outline the model and create the graphs corresponding to each layer on the ipu you want them to be executed on. You can use `popxl.ipu(ipu_index)` context for that.\n",

    "\n",
    "Within this context you specify the pipeline stages writing operations inside a `pipeline.stage(stage_index)` context and you decide the ipu where they are executed using `popxl.ipu(ipu_index)` context.\n",

    "When the pipeline context closes, the transformation is run and the current graph ends up with a single `ops.call` that executes the pipeline:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are no constraints on how many or which ipus a stage can run on. However, any communication between ipus will cause a syncronisation that can stall the pipeline. In general, we want the data dependencies between stages to only be represented as `ops.ipu_copy` or `Tensor.copy_to_ipu`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being a loop, if you have `host_load` in the pipeline you need to remember to set the `ir.num_host_transfers` property equal to the pipeline steps.\n",
