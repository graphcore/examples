    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT fine-tuning is when you train a BERT model on a supervised learning task on a relatively small amount of data, by using starting weights obtained from pre-training on a large, generic text corpus. Pre-training of BERT requires a lot of unlabelled data (for instance all of Wikipedia + thousands of books) and a lot of compute. It is expensive and time-consuming, but after pre-training BERT will have learned an extremely good language model that can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks with small amount of labelled data, achieving great results.\n",

Using an IPU-POD16 we can move the optimiser on-chip to speed up the model (see below) and rearrange our model to fit across 4 IPU's.
