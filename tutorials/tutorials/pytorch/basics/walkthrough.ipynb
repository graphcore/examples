    "## What is PopTorch?\n",
    "\n",
    "PopTorch is a set of extensions for PyTorch to enable PyTorch models to run\n",
    "on Graphcore's IPU hardware.\n",
    "\n",
    "PopTorch supports both inference and training. To run a model on the IPU you\n",
    "wrap your existing PyTorch model in either a PopTorch inference wrapper or\n",
    "a PopTorch training wrapper. You can provide further annotations to partition\n",
    "the model across multiple IPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can wrap individual layers in an IPU helper to designate which IPU they\n",
    "should go on. Using your annotations, PopTorch will use\n",
    "[PopART](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/popart-user-guide/en/latest/) to parallelise\n",
    "the model over the given number of IPUs. Additional parallelism\n",
    "can be expressed via a replication factor which enables you to\n",
    "data-parallelise the model over more IPUs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Under the hood PopTorch uses\n",
    "[TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html), an intermediate\n",
    "representation (IR) of a PyTorch model, using the `torch.jit.trace` API. That\n",
    "means it inherits the constraints of that API. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Inputs must be Torch tensors or tuples/lists containing Torch tensors\n",
    "- `None` can be used as a default value for a parameter but cannot be explicitly\n",
    "  passed as an input value\n",
    "- Hooks and `.grad` cannot be used to inspect weights and gradients\n",
    "- `torch.jit.trace` cannot handle control flow or shape variations within the\n",
    "  model. That is, the inputs passed at run-time cannot vary the control flow of\n",
    "  the model or the shapes/sizes of results.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about TorchScript and JIT, you can go through the [Introduction\n",
    "to TorchScript tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/Intro_to_TorchScript_tutorial.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "PopTorch has been designed to require only a few manual changes to your models\n",
    "in order to run them on the IPU. However, it does have some differences from\n",
    "native PyTorch execution and not all PyTorch operations have been\n",
    "implemented in the backend yet. You can find the list of supported operations\n",
