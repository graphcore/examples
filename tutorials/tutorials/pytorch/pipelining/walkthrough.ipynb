    "Pipelining is the recommended strategy\n",
    "when a model is too large to fit into the memory of a single IPU.\n",

    "There are two parts: a Jupyter notebook and a Python script. The notebook works through how you use the pipelining API to define pipelines in PopTorch. The `mnist_pipeline.py` script shows the effect of hyper-parameters on a pipelined model's execution schedule when the model is run on the IPU.\n",
    "In this tutorial you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the PopTorch pipelining API to execute a model over multiple IPUs in parallel.\n",
    "- Partition a model into blocks (`poptorch.Block`) and group them into pipeline stages (`poptorch.Stage`).\n",
    "- Learn how gradient accumulation and device iteration hyperparameters impact performance.\n",
    "- Debug a multi-IPU model using a sharded execution schedule (`poptorch.ShardedExecution`).\n",
    "- Learn how to offload the optimiser tensors to save memory on device.\n",
    "- Use the [Popvision Graph Analyser](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/graph-analyser-userguide/) to look at execution profiles and understand how pipelining impacts the scheduling of a model across IPUs.\n",

    "If you are unfamiliar with PopTorch, you may want to check out our tutorial introducing PopTorch `../basics`\n",
    "and learn how to convert a model from PyTorch to PopTorch to make it run on a Graphcore IPU.\n",

    "This is the recommended strategy when a model does not fit into the memory of a single IPU.\n",
    "To pipeline a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the model must be partitioned into multiple stages;\n",
