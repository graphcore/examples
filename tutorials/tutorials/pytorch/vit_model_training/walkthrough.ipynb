    "# Multi-label Classification on IPU using ViT - Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "This PyTorch tutorial will show you how to reuse a Hugging Face model and train it on the IPU using a local dataset.\n",
    "Specifically, we will be fine-tuning a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to detect multiple diseases from chest X-rays. As an X-ray image can have multiple diseases we will be training a multi-label classification model.\n",
    "We will use [Graphcore's Optimum interface](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore) to the [Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) to run an existing model on the IPU.\n",
    "We will be using the [google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/google/vit-base-patch16-224-in21k) pretrained on ImageNet, fine-tuning it on the NIH Chest X-ray Dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to:\n",
    "- Repurpose one of the examples from the [Graphcore organisation page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore) to fit your use case.\n",
    "- Preprocess a dataset to fit it to an existing model.\n",
    "- Use the Graphcore model cards found on the [Graphcore organisation page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore) and reuse checkpoints and config files released by Graphcore.\n",
    "- Maximise IPU utilisation for your specific machine by overriding runtime parameters in the `IPUconfig` object made available in the model cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "If this is your first time using IPUs, read the [IPU Programmer's Guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/latest/) to learn the basic concepts.\n",
    "To run your own PyTorch model on the IPU see the PyTorch basics tutorial `../basics`, or to see all existing Graphcore models available from Hugging Face go to the [Graphcore organisation page](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore)."

    "If you're running this on other IPU hardware, you will need to do the following:\n",
    "- Download the `/images` directory and unpack all images. You can use `bash` to extract the files: `for f in images*.tar.gz; do tar xfz \"$f\"; done`.\n",
    "Also download the `Data_Entry_2017_v2020.csv` file, which contains the labels. By default the tutorial expects the `/images` folder and csv file to be in the folder `chest-xray-nihcc-3`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to run this demo is on Paperspace Gradient’s cloud IPUs because everything is already set up for you. To improve your experience we preload datasets and pre-install packages. This can take a few minutes. If you experience errors immediately after starting a session please try restarting the kernel before contacting support. If a problem persists or you want to give us feedback on the content of this notebook, please reach out to through our community of developers using our [slack channel](https://www.graphcore.ai/join-community) or raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/graphcore/Gradient-PyTorch/issues).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the demo using other IPU hardware, you need to have the Poplar SDK enabled. Refer to the [Getting Started guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html#getting-started) for your system for details on how to enable the Poplar SDK. Also refer to the [Jupyter Quick Start guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/jupyter-notebook-quick-start/en/latest/index.html) for how to set up Jupyter to be able to run this notebook on a remote IPU machine.\n",

    "In this tutorial we have shown how to train a Hugging Face model on the IPU using a local dataset.\n",
    "To do this, we:\n",
    "- loaded the local dataset using the Hugging Face `datasets` package,\n",
    "- defined transforms to ensure the dataset was compatible with the model,\n",
    "- defined the `IPUTrainer` class to allow the model to run on the IPU,\n",
    "- ran the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset required preprocessing before being compatible with the `datasets` package.\n",
    "We needed to encode the labels as N-hot arrays to make them compatible with the `load_dataset` function.\n",
    "To improve the training of the model, device parameters were loaded and customised in the `IPUConfig` object and hyperparameters were tuned in the `IPUTrainer` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are now ready to use Graphcore and Hugging Face models for your own application.\n",
