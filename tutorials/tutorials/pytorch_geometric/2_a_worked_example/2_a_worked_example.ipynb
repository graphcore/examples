    "In this tutorial we saw an end to end example of running a GNN on IPUs for a particular task.\n",

    "We built a simple GNN model based on the the `GCNConv` layer provided by the PyTorch Geometric library, trained it with PopTorch and predicted the `Cora` dataset node features.\n",

    "A more in-depth overview of the data handling techniques needed for other types of graph problems can be found in the following links:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are interested in \"small graph\" problems of the type found in healthcare and chemistry, we recommend you check out the tutorials 3 and 4 on [Small Graph Batching with Padding](../3_small_graph_batching_with_padding/3_small_graph_batching_with_padding.ipynb) and [Small Graph Batching with Packing](../4_small_graph_batching_with_packing/4_small_graph_batching_with_packing.ipynb).\n",
    "- If you are looking to apply GNNs to larger graphs, similar to those found in online advertising, shopping and social networks, we recommend you to jump to our [Cluster CGN example](../../../../gnn/cluster_gcn/pytorch_geometric/node_classification_with_cluster_gcn.ipynb), which showcases how to train it for node classification using sampling.
