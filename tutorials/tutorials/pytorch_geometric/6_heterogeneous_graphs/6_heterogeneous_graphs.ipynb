    "# Heterogeneous Graph Learning on IPUs\n",
    "\n",
    "Many real-world graphs are heterogeneous, meaning single node types and edge types are insufficient to capture all the information in the graph, leading to graphs which have different node types and different edge types between those nodes. This comes with a few considerations, for example how do we construct a model suitable for training with heterogeneous graph data and how do we create mini-batches from this data. We will answer both of those questions, focussing on using Graphcore IPUs to enable accelerating heterogeneous graph learning workloads.\n",

    "### Using heterogeneous operators\n",

    "The final approach PyG provides to create a heterogeneous GNN model is to use operators specifically designed for heterogeneous graphs. An example of such an operator is the [HGTConv layer](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/torch_geometric.nn.conv.HGTConv.html#torch_geometric.nn.conv.HGTConv). These operators can be used as normal, taking care to make the modifications to enable running on IPUs.\n",

    "## Fixed size heterogeneous data loading\n",
    "\n",
    "As real-world heterogeneous graphs can be quite large, it may often be appropriate to move from full-batch training to mini-batch training using some form of sampling. PyTorch Geometric provides a range of samplers suitable for heterogeneous graphs, for example `NeighborLoader` which we will look at.\n",
    "\n",
    "When moving from full-batch to mini-batch on the IPU, one must consider the sizes of the mini-batches. The IPU uses ahead-of-time compilation, which means all mini-batches must be the same size. In the homogeneous graph case, making our mini-batches a fixed size is relatively trivial, adding padding to make the nodes and edges up to a fixed size. This becomes more complex with heterogeneous graphs when there are different node and edge types.\n",

We have seen in other tutorials how we can make a mini-batch fixed size for homogeneous graphs, for example in the case of neighbour loading see the tutorial [../5_large_graph_sampling](../5_large_graph_sampling). For heterogeneous graphs we must extend this idea and think about how to make each node and edge type a fixed size. The simplest approach would be to pad all node and edge types to the same value. To do this first we will create `FixedSizeOptions` specifying `num_nodes` and `num_edges` as in the homogeneous case."
