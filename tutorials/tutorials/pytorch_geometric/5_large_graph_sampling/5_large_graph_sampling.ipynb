    "# Sampling Large Graphs for IPUs using PyTorch Geometric\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous PyTorch Geometric (PyG) tutorials we have been focussed on working with datasets comprising of many small graphs. For some modern applications, however, we will need to operate on larger graphs characterised by increasing number of nodes (range 10M-10B) and edges (range 100M-100B). Imagine having to build a recommendation system for a social network type of input graph, which can contain a huge number of users (nodes) and relationships (edges). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of approaching large graph problems:\n",
    "- Full batch training: This is the approach we have been using in the tutorial [An End-to-end Example using PyTorch Geometric on IPUs](https://ipu.dev/O2u8MZ) when working with a single, relatively small graph. The aim is to generate embeddings for all the nodes at the same time. This means keeping the entire graph, as well as all the node embeddings, in memory. If the size of the computational graph increases, the amount of memory required to hold graph and embeddings becomes challenging for modern accelerators. \n",
    "- Mini-batching: We can also create mini-batches by sampling from the graph. When sampling from a larger graph we need to be extra careful to reduce the chances of the sampled nodes being isolated from each other. If the sampled nodes are isolated, then the mini-batches would no longer be representative of the whole graph. This would negatively impact our machine learning task. The need here is to engineer effective sampling methods to make sure that the message passing scheme is still effective with large graphs. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate two sampling approaches widely used in literature to cope with increasing graph size. For each we will finish with training using the Graphcore IPU, which is a great fit for GNN applications as explained in the blog post [Accelerating PyG on IPUs: Unleash the Power of Graph Neural Networks](https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/accelerating-pyg-on-ipus-unleash-the-power-of-graph-neural-networks), and the PyG integration for IPUs. You will learn how to: \n",
    "- effectively cluster nodes of your input graph; \n",
    "- sample neighbouring nodes of your input graph; \n",
    "- then, for both sampling methods, train your GNN on IPUs to classify papers from the PubMed dataset.\n",

The IPU relies on ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation, hence it needs the input tensors to have fixed sizes.

    "The neighbourhood sampling approach was firstly introduced in the [GraphSAGE](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02216v4) paper for creating inductive node embeddings. The idea here is to learn how to aggregate node feature information from a node's K-hop neighbourhood, where K is the number of layers of our GNN and the number of iterations we want to perform. This means we have relatively small memory requirements. To generate the embeddings of a node we only need to know the K-hop neighbourhood structure around that node and the relative node features. We don't need to store the rest of the graph. In this way, the mini-batches are going to be made up of K-hop neighbourhoods which should fit nicely into the device's memory. \n",
