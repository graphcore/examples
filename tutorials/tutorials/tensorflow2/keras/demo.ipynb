If a problem persists or you want to give us feedback on the content of this notebook, please reach out to through our community of developers using our [Slack channel](https://www.graphcore.ai/join-community) or raise a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/graphcore/Gradient-Tensorflow2/issues).\n",

    "#### Pipelining\n",
    "\n",
    "For models that require multiple IPUs, for example due to their size,\n",
    "pipelining can be used to maximise the use of the IPUs involved by executing\n",
    "different parts of the model in parallel. A pipelined model assigns sections\n",
    "(called _stages_) of the model to different IPUs, concurrently processing\n",
    "different mini-batches of data through each stage.\n",

    "training:\n",

    "\n",
    "In order to maximise the utilisation of IPUs during execution of a pipelined\n",
    "model you should aim to increase the time spent in the _main execution phase_.\n",
    "Pipelining has 3 phases: ramp up, main execution, and ramp down. During the ramp\n",
    "up and down phases not all the IPUs are in use, by increasing the number of\n",
    "mini-batches that are processed before performing a weight update, we increase\n",

    "Another technique to help pipelining efficiency on the IPU is\n",

    "With gradient accumulation, instead of updating the weights between each\n",
    "mini-batch, forward and backward passes are performed on several mini-batches,\n",
    "while keeping a cumulative sum of the gradients. A weight update is applied\n",
    "based on this accumulated gradient after the specified number of mini-batches\n",
    "has been processed. This ensures consistency between the weights used in the\n",
    "forward and backward passes while increasing the time spent in the main\n",
    "execution phase. We call the processing of a mini-batch a _gradient accumulation\n",
    "step_, and the number of mini-batches processed between weight updates is the\n",
    "number of gradient accumulation steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "By processing multiple mini-batches between weight updates, gradient\n",
    "accumulation increases the effective batch size of our training process. With\n",
