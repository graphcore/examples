# Optimising Temporary Memory Usage for Convolutions and Matmuls on the IPU

This directory contains the supporting code and tests for the [technical note on
setting the available memory proportion for convolutions and
matmuls](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/available-memory/en/3.2.0/).

Further information on memory optimisation can be found in the technical note [Memory and
Performance Optimisation on the IPU](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/memory-performance-optimisation/en/3.2.0/common-memory-optimisations.html).
