Values within each group are then binned into one of 16 values (4 bits), and we store scale and bias factors in float16 to allow us to convert from 4 bits, back to float16 when we compute. This means the column dimension of the weights matrix must be divisible by `n`. Since native 4-bit formats don't exist, we store four consecutive 4-bit integers in a 16-bit integer value. As a result, `n` must be divisible by 4.\n",

    "You can see that the uncompressed checkpoint produces the most accurate results, but is also the slowest. As you increase `group_size`, token generation time gets smaller and accuracy degrades quite smoothly. For group sizes > 128, you can see that accuracy degrades very sharply, without much improvement in speed. The best tradeoff looks to be for `group_size=64`, since you need a significantly slower model to obtain a marginal improvement in accuracy, whereas an only slightly faster model produces quite a big dropoff in accuracy. Depending on your requirements, you might decide differently, for example you may want a little bit more quality even if it means your model runs slower. \n",
