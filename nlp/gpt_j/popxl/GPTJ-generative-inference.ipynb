    "# Text generation with GPT-J 6B\n",
    "\n",
    "[GPT-J](https://huggingface.co/EleutherAI/gpt-j-6B) is a causal decoder-only transformer model which can be used for text-generation.\n",
    "Causal means that a causal mask is used in the decoder attention, so that each token has visibility of previous tokens only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models are very powerful because a huge variety of tasks can be formulated as text-to-text problems and thus adapted to fit the generative setup, where the model is asked to correctly predict future tokens. This idea has been widely explored in the [T5 paper: Exploring the Limits of Transfer Learning with a Unified\n",
    "Text-to-Text Transformer](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.10683.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for these kind of tasks you don't need GPT-3 175B sized models. GPT-J at 6B has very good language understanding and is suitable for most of these scenarios. Larger models give only a small improvement in language understanding. Mainly they add more world knowledge and better performance at free text generation as might be used in an AI Assistant or chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- generate text in 5 lines of code with GPT-J on the Graphcore IPU;\n",
    "- use GPT-J to answer questions and build prompts to reliably use text-generation for more specific NLP tasks;\n",
    "- explore the effect on the model of the prompt format and compare the model performance with 0-shot (no examples included in the prompt) and few-shot prompting (where a few typical examples are included in the prompt);\n",
    "- Improve text generation throughput using batched inference;\n",
    "- understand the limitations of the base GPT-J checkpoint when it comes to more complex NLP tasks;\n",
    "- use the model to identify whether statements agree or disagree (entailment). For this more complex task, we show the benefit of fine-tuning and load a checkpoint fine-tuned on the MNLI dataset from the Hugging Face Hub which achieves much better performance on this specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The MNLI checkpoint on Hugging Face mentioned above has been fine-tuned on IPU. No finetuning is performed in this notebook but  you can learn more on fine-tuning GPT-J in the [finetuning notebook](finetuning.ipynb).\n",
    "By exploring this notebook, you will gain insight into how various tasks can be formulated in a text-to-text format and how this flexibility can be utilized to fine-tune the model using your own dataset."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook has demonstrated how easy it is to run GPT-J on the Graphcore IPU using this implementation of the model and 🤗 Hugging Face Hub checkpoints of the model weights. While not as powerful as larger models for free text-generation, medium-size auto-regressive models like GPT-J can still be successfully fine-tuned to handle a range of NLP tasks such as question answering, sentiment analysis, and named entity recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In less than 10 lines of code, we were able to load the model onto the IPU and perform NLP tasks. We showed how the prompt format influences the model output and built structured prompts for question answering. We demonstrated how batched inference can be used to increase throughput by generating multiple answers at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also tackled the more complex task of determining entailment between statements, and found that the standard GPT-J checkpoint was not effective.\n",
    "We tried few-shot prompting, concatenating several examples in the input prompt, to give the model instructions for the task. Even with some improvement, this technique wasn't enough for the general model to successfully classify entailment.\n",
    "Finally, we showed that a model fine-tuned on this specific downstream task (using the MNLI GLUE dataset) performs much better, achieving approximately 80% accuracy on 200 validation samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this notebook showcases the potential for GPT-J to be used effectively and efficiently on several downstream tasks after a simple fine-tuning.\n",
    "Next, find out how to fine-tune GPT-J on the IPU in our notebook on fine-tuning [GPT-J on the MNLI dataset](finetuning.ipynb)."
