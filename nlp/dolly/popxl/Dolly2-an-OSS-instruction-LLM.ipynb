    "[Dolly 2.0](https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm) is a 12B parameter language model trained and instruction fine-tuned by [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com). By instruction fine-tuning the large language model (LLM), we obtain an LLM better suited for human interactivity. Crucially, Databricks released all code, model weights, and their fine-tuning dataset with an open-source license that permits commercial use. This makes Dolly 2.0 the world's first, truly open-source instruction-tuned LLM. In this notebook, we will show you how to run Dolly 2.0 using Graphcore IPUs on Paperspace with your own prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook you will:\n",
    "- Create and configure a Dolly inference pipeline.\n",
    "- Run Dolly inference on a text prompts to generate answers to user specified questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook requires a minimum of 4 IPUs to run. This notebook also supports running on a POD16, resulting in a faster pipeline inference speed.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we have demonstrated how you can easily run Dolly 2.0 for inference on Graphcore IPUs on text prompts. Instruction fine-tuning is a powerful method of turning a base LLM into one more suited for human interactivity, such as a question-answer model or a chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although larger instruction LLMs exist with more world knowledge such as ChatGPT, they are closed-source or are subject to non-commercial licensing. This makes Dolly 2.0 a significant milestone as the first of its kind, with future instruction fine-tuned LLMs no doubt to quickly follow. All of which will be truly open."
